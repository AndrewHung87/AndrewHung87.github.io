### CPSC 120

* Lab 8

    My most enjoyable laboratory task was Part 2 of Lab 8, which focused on verifying whether a user-inputted number is prime or not. The process of 
    determining prime numbers is inherently challenging. During my time in junior high school, I committed to memory all prime numbers from 1 to 100. 
    However, upon engaging in this lab, I realized that once we discern the underlying logical principles, we can effortlessly translate them into 
    self-authored functions, thereby simplifying and expediting the calculations significantly.
