### CPSC 120

* Lab 8

    My most enjoyable laboratory task was Part 2 of Lab 8, which focused on verifying whether a user-inputted number is prime or not. The process of determining prime numbers is inherently challenging. During my time in junior high school, I committed to memory all prime numbers from 1 to 100. However, upon engaging in this lab, I realized that once we discern the underlying logical principles, we can effortlessly translate them into self-authored functions, thereby simplifying and expediting the calculations significantly.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, Part 2 was particularly engaging for me due to my longstanding interest in Blackjack and prior exploration of probability concepts. This lab proved instrumental in enhancing my skills as I successfully developed functions capable of accurately computing the value of a Blackjack hand, irrespective of the number of Aces dealt. The newfound ability to generate precise calculations in this context represents a significant milestone in my programming journey.

* Lab 12

    Third one of my preferred components was Part of Lab 12, which centered around creating animations solely through code. The notion of generating a running animation purely from lines of code might initially appear challenging for many individuals. However, this lab provided a valuable insight into the remarkable possibilities that can be achieved through programming, showcasing the potential to bring captivating animations to life through the power of code.
